# Hyperdimensional-Scalars-A-Novel-Mathematical-Construc
This repository introduces a new mathematical concept, Hyperdimensional Scalars, which extends traditional number systems by incorporating hierarchical, multi-layered interactions. The idea combines the principles of real and imaginary numbers while introducing a new structure to model higher-dimensional systems and nested dependencies.
This work is exploratory, and I am sharing it openly to invite feedback, collaboration, and refinement from the mathematical and scientific communities.
